# Quote-Generator
This is just a simple quote generator platform created with the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

I created this following the teachings of my professor on an online Udemy course adding my own twist and flavor to the quote generator. 
It takes a bunch of quotes from an Api and randomly chooses a quote each time the page is reloaded or the new button is clicked. 
It also gives you the option to tweet those quotes directly to the X Platform. 

Working on this project gave me the opportunity to create and work on async functions in javaScript and helped me to understand it even 
better than I did before. There was so much to take from doing this project, it was fun and very beneficial for my growth as a developer.
