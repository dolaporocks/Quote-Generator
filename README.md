# Quote-Generator
This is just a simple quote generator platform created with the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

I created this following the teachings of my professor on an online Udemy course adding my own twist and flavor to the quote generator. 
It takes a bunch of quotes from an Api and randomly chooses a quote each time the page is reloaded or the new button is clicked. 
It also gives you the option to tweet those quotes directly to the X Platform.
